Usually on different reddits there is 1 or 2 people so.. thank you 🙏</p>\n<p>According to your suggestions I have created a <strong>subreddit</strong> for this purposes here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/martianSapiens\">https://www.reddit.com/r/martianSapiens</a></p>\n<p>My main goal is to let joy of creativity power learning skills. Let’s learn together. I will be posting interesting information about Mars and other stuff since I want this game to embed set of <strong>real rules</strong>. You can brainstorm with me as ideas surge together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hubo/\"><strong>hubo</strong></a> suggested that I <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en\">should not let others know</a> about my goals. I don’t. I do not know the finale of this, where it leads me but those words here, is already working on it.</p>\n<h2>The truths you cannot omit - Earth Rules</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life is a game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A game, with a sets of rules. Rules that are unbreakable and rules that are soft - conventions. The unbreakable rules is harsh physics we don’t always get. I - for instance - find difficult to comprehend time relativity. How the fact that <em>astronauts on the orbit age more slowly due to their high orbital speed</em> affects our lives?</p>\n<p>There is also the educational delay - knowledge on a lot of laws we know do not propagate to millions of people (at least not as fast and profound as we would like). Theory of evolution, genome, fiat money. Most people are not aware of the knowledge that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&#x26;list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D\">literally explains their behavior</a>.</p>\n<p>It seems that we on Earth play by one rule that is called money. Gold naturally became as a mean of exchange because it was <a href=\"https://mises.org/library/history-money-and-banking-united-states-colonial-era-world-war-ii\">the most scarce and lasting material</a> known to us. We basically were saving our time in an ore. We still do. The visible, touchable things was our currency for most of the time. Now we advanced it a level higher, we use magnetic discs and electricity to store and compute money.</p>\n<p>Generating <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html\">trillions of papers</a> (or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrjoElG8KGI\">once and zeros</a>) is just like using hacks in a big MMORPG. There are some out there who have access to hacks and get full backpacks of dollars literally after clicking enter. All others have to “farm like noobs” - which is work in a normal job or grinding.</p>\n<p>Grinding that’s been recently popular - it can be learning some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4LQTp-fhuo\">useless skills</a> in order to get 1 tiny drop of that fake money. It can be learning <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">more complicated skills</a> to get more drops of that same, fake money. The problem is that you can buy a real brain surgery with fake money. But.. it means that redistributing trillions of dollars (collective time and efforts) could do good things, right?</p>\n<p>Have you seen all those wonders done by bankers and politicians? If so, let me know in the comments. Maybe I will change my mind.</p>\n<h2>Life is a game and I got bored playing it</h2>\n<p>It’s like you are exping in a nice, farming place and a hacker comes and kills all of them with one hit.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin: 15px -30px !important max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"MapleStory Hacker\"\n        title=\"MapleStory Hacker\"\n        src=\"/static/4dcaf0b35f797e02b69d1c290fb4e018/29d31/maple-story-hacker.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4dcaf0b35f797e02b69d1c290fb4e018/e52aa/maple-story-hacker.jpg 175w,\n/static/4dcaf0b35f797e02b69d1c290fb4e018/70ebb/maple-story-hacker.jpg 350w,\n/static/4dcaf0b35f797e02b69d1c290fb4e018/29d31/maple-story-hacker.jpg 700w,\n/static/4dcaf0b35f797e02b69d1c290fb4e018/72e01/maple-story-hacker.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p><em>pic1: Maple Story Hacker killing all mobs at once.</em></p>\n<p>You get annoyed, change map or spot and continue playing. It’s fine. The problem is that the hacker is still cheating and later when you go to a marketplace, you will see prices given by him. It’s still fine, you can just change a game or play a singleplayer. <strong>You can’t do that in real life.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if we assume that we live in a simulation or Matrix, we don’t know how to disconnect and play the singleplayer (besides, the biggest fun is to play together!). The only singleplayer I can imagine is the one with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TWYDogv4WQ\"><em>Wilson the volleyball</em></a>, and it does not look like fun!</p>\n<p>Without a common goal, shared understanding, with billions of players and thousands of very powerful hackers (which we can’t even ban from the game) I must say, that playing over the current rules got totally meaningless. I am not saying it’s pointless!</p>\n<p>There is still real value in small percentage of today’s economy and people still believe in the paper. Pursuing the money to some extend is necessary, we all need it for survival. We all are (at least) a set of bio-hardware that emerged from the code (the body that is the <a href=\"https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/what-is-life/\">outcome of the code</a>) thus as organisms we need to fulfill <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">the basic rules</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem I see in hackers that waste collective efforts in the real world is that it decreases amount of creativity that exist in the world. If people have to struggle more to stay afloat or fulfill basic needs it stops them from dreaming. Nikola Tesla said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Invention is the most important product of creative brain. Be creative is to achieve mastery over the material world. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The meaninglessness can be filled with creativity. If you can’t fix the world then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZCfNAl6DWE\">at least change your reaction</a>. My reaction to hackers is staying cheerful by being creative. I have a great and meaningful job (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs\">in comparsion to some</a>) that allows me to put some time into creativity.</p>\n<p>Investigating about Mars, about life, respect and values we cherish is more valuable for me than mounting and riding the hustle wave. I believe that the bubble that is being pumped originates in the banking system which originates from the values we cherish. Kind of self perpetuating destruction mode that I am breaking by following <em>my</em> way. Charlie Munger says that he and Warren Buffer became rich by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-4_ONHa_xc\">following basic morality</a> (and they don’t like the system that is now). He also points to young people <strong>a set of advices which I am going to follow</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not overspend your income.</li>\n<li>Live long (at least I will try).</li>\n<li>Don’t pity yourself, do not feel resentment, stay cheerful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pretty simple set of rules that allows you to <strong>just sit own and focus on the development</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is tons of fun in life. There has to be. For me - excitement and joy of being alive must be present. Otherwise I start making life of others more difficult. This journey is the contrary of dull and meaningless. I don’t want to make just another platform, shooter etc. Copying is boring, there is so much to discover! Plus - <strong>imagine a game about colonizing Mars begin played in the future by children born on Mars!</strong></p>\n<p>I have already travelled there, part of me at least (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/participate/send-your-name/mars2020/\">my name written on a tag</a> is there). Probably I won’t ever go there but I would love to feel like being there and solving the problems that they will be facing. Now it’s the time to do it! Next post will be just about that.</p>\n<p>Can you imagine colonizing Mars before actually colonizing Mars? How cool would that be!</p>\n<h2>What all that has to do with Mars?</h2>\n<p><strong>Creating my own rules of course!</strong></p>\n<p>I believe that in order to make really cool game about Mars’ and our life over there we need to know about life here, on Earth. All what I have said will not be explicitly showed in the game but it should be reflected somehow there. The fact that people focus on pure entertainment makes all games look empty, monotonous. Stardew Valley is great partially because ConcernedApe was concerned enough to stop and think about capitalism and his in-game coins system etc.</p>\n<p>I know that setting on such a difficult and creative Journey of developing a game has to start somewhere meaningful. Would you like to waste a few years of your life just to do another shooting platform? There is more to life, more to games. Let’s start investigating then!</p>\n<p>Maybe you have heard about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8\">Game of Life</a> made by a computer scientist. He made a set of rules that enable creation of another “life”. People took it to another level and they used the life that those rules create and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8\">made another Game of Life within it</a>! It is exactly like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sEbe9gveN4\">one of Rick and Morty episodes</a>. The point is: We have power to create. Create new rules of life.</p>\n<p>There is a set of rules, a game on Mars. Rules embedded in reality. They are different than the one we have on Earth. Atmosphere, gravity, energy (sun). I want to discover some of them and encapsulate them in a form of a video game.</p>\n<p>This brings joy. Creativity. The process of discovering, digging up the idea and making it real. Have you ever played a dull, repetitive game, where there was a sidequest, a game machine of some sort, with a minigame better than the main one? That’s how I feel now.</p>\n<h2>Let’s move to Mars now</h2>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin: 15px -30px !important max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 50.28571428571429%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAKABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHlvmrJYn//xAAZEAEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIQEjH/2gAIAQEAAQUCBhVmuK9n/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABES/9oACAEDAQE/Aa0//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABH/2gAIAQIBAT8BR//EABQQAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQEABj8CX//EABwQAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABITEQYRFBkf/aAAgBAQABPyFPib2xjt+m0sVFWP/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQ2x//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPxC1P//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAECAQE/EIP/xAAcEAEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAMRBBUYH/2gAIAQEAAT8QnMgFxuHeeg33T494Jt+i98QI424BdG8//9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Mars Beauty\"\n        title=\"Mars Beauty\"\n        src=\"/static/b0323cebd09d36df0d8cf12afc3cec34/29d31/mars-beauty.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b0323cebd09d36df0d8cf12afc3cec34/e52aa/mars-beauty.jpg 175w,\n/static/b0323cebd09d36df0d8cf12afc3cec34/70ebb/mars-beauty.jpg 350w,\n/static/b0323cebd09d36df0d8cf12afc3cec34/29d31/mars-beauty.jpg 700w,\n/static/b0323cebd09d36df0d8cf12afc3cec34/72e01/mars-beauty.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>Mars is empty.
